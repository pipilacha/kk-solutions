### Task
The Nautilus DevOps team is conducting application deployment tests on selected application servers. They require a nginx container deployment on Application Server 2. 

Complete the task with the following instructions:
* On Application Server 2 create a container named nginx_2 using the nginx image with the alpine tag. Ensure container is in a running state.


### Solution
1. Let's check existing containers
 ```
    [steve@stapp02 ~]$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

2. Lets run the desired container.
    * Will map ports 80:80 as it is not specified.
    * Will run in detach mode
    * There is no volume requirement
```
[steve@stapp02 ~]$ docker run --name nginx_2 -p 80:80 -d nginx:alpine
